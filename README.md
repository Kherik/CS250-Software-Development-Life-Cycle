# CS250-Software-Development-Life-Cycle
I interpret and implement a user's needs by creating a sort of pseudo logic that can be translated from a normal language into computer developmental language.
Creating user stories makes a detailed ordered list that is more interpretable by a human to translate it into something that the computer can recognize.
To develop code I keep in my mind that each of these user stories is really just a problem that needs to get churned through and algorithm of code and 
spit out on the other side to create a solution. With this mind set and a grasp of clean conventional code, I can write a program that other programmer can read
as if they developed the code. Especially while using the comment notations to interate what has been done. And what's more is github allows version edition, which
is a powerful way of saving iterations of code so you can experiment and back track if needed.
To be a good software development you need to be open and honest to yourself and your team, about your skill set and obstacles. You need to help other and be
proactive when problems arise and not sit on the sidelines. Put in as much value if not more than what you retreive from your team.
